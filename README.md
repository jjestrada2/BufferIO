# Buffered I/O Library in C 🧞‍♂️

## Overview🤗

This project involves implementing a custom buffered I/O library in C. The library provides three primary functions for managing file operations: `b_open`, `b_read`, and `b_close`. The implementation relies on low-level APIs to interact with the file system.

## Files🙌

- **b_io.c**: Contains the implementations of `b_open`, `b_read`, and `b_close`.
- **b_io.h**: Header file declaring the function prototypes and necessary type definitions.
- **Low-Level API**: Includes `LBAread` and `GetFileInfo` functions, provided separately.


**Prototype:**

The output will vary each run but at the end you should see:

```
We have read 8120 characters from file DecOfInd.txt
We have read 1877 characters from file CommonSense.txt
```
